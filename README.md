# Supernovae
A W.I.P chat platform made as a learning experience and to test out ideas I've had.

## Ideas
- Decentralisation
  - Would be more robust as it'd allow users to host their own instances,
    yet still be able to connect with others on another instance.

  - This could make instances more vulnerable to spam, but that's why
    blacklists exist. Instances could easily form a mutual blacklist of
    banned instances. Plus, instances would *have* to be attached to a
    domain to be able to interact with other instances to minimise abuse.
